shiny-pancake
=============

Shiny-pancake is a renderer that takes commands (or even complete replays!) from stdin, I've used
this to visualize replays for AIs on CodinGame, but I'm sure it has more uses than just that.

Want to try it? [Here](https://github.com/SwagColoredKitteh/shiny-pancake)'s the GitHub repository.
